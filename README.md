# Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc
  1) Code side one model meta data for Data annotation was new for me as core uses the ModelMetaDataType attribute from Core MVC instead of MetaDataType attribute. 
  2) Date picker related front end was took time as long time grip because of legacy project. 
  3) Took few more hours as I wanted to make it look and function properly.
