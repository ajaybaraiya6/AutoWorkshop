1) I could separate vehicle with drop down list getting from other tables and set there ids instead of text values. for a quick and consistant data. 
2) Only did server side validation using Data annotation for quick way, so Can do client side validation as well. 
3) I would check for lazy loading of all the listing views. for high number of records. 
4) Can Show Vehicle related error messages and more validation and restriction for crud on it.
5) Also filter column wise and once filtered then after any edit/delete/view operation keep on search view for filtered results. 
6) Improve UI.
7) For booking I can select first customer then based on that I will list the Vehicles and then select other things and Save. 
8) After inserting a new booking I can show booking details so that user can aware that our record has been created.
